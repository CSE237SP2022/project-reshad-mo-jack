This is a really simple connect four game written in Java. A text-based board is displayed to the user, and can be interacted by input coordinates in turn. Upon winning, the game displays the winner and quits. Note that two players are needed for this game.  


# Iteration 1


## What user stories were completed this iteration?

Allow player1/player2 input names in console.

## What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?

Basic playing functionalities.

## Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?

Edge cases might not behave properly.

## What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)


# Iteration 2


## What user stories were completed this iteration?

Game can be played by two players in a 8x8 board.

## What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?

Better displaying features on which player won or tied the game. Will add more features in custom game as well.

## Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?

Some extreme edge cases might not behave properly. Col and row might be used intertwinedly. 

## What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)

Run the script './run.sh' from command line



# Iteration 3


## What user stories were completed this iteration?

The game can be played at a board with dimensions 4-10, with two players smoothly.

## What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?

Fixed bugs

## Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?

Std draw was attempted to replace the current text based output, but didn't get it work. It is not merged to the main branch to ensure the main still works.

## What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)

Run the script './run.sh' from command line
